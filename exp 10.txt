Exp No: 10   BOOLEAN OPERATIONS USING CAD 
Aim: To implement Boolean Commands using CAD. Boolean operation was named after George 
Boole, who first defined an algebraic system of logic in the mid-19th century. 
Working in 3D usually involves the use of solid objects. At times you may need to combine multiple 
parts into one, or remove sections from a solid. AutoCAD has some commands that make this easy 
for you. These are the Boolean operations as well as some other helpful commands for solids 
editing.

DESCRIPTION 
 
 
UNION 
 
 
UNION/U
 NI 
 
 
 
Joins two or more fields 
into creating one based on 
the total geometry of all 
 
 
SUBTRA
 CT 
 
 
SUBTRAC
 T//SU 
 
 
 
Subtracts one or more 
solids from another 
creating a solid based on 
the remaining geometry. 
 
 
INTERS
 ECT 
 
 
INTERSE
 CT/IN 
 
 
 
Creates a single solid 
from one more solids 
based on the intersected 
geometry 
 
 
EXTRU
 DE 
FAC
 E 
 
 
SOLIDEDI
 T 
 
 
 
Allows you to increase the 
size of a solid by extruding 
out one of its faces 
 
 
SLICE 
 
 
SLICE 
 
 
 
 
Slices a solid along a 
cutting plane 
 
 
3D 
ALIGN 
 
 
3DALIGN 
 
 
 
Aligns two 3D Objects in 
3D Space. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Result: Thus Boolean Commands have been successfully implemented using CAD.
