Exp No: 2  BASIC COMMANDS IN CAD DRAW, MODIFY AND DISPLAY 
 
 
Aim: To implement draw, modify and display basic commands using CAD. 
 
DRAW COMMANDS: 
These AutoCAD commands are essential for creating precise geometric shapes. Mastering them can significantly increase 
your productivity in CAD design. 
 
LINE: It is used to draw a straight line between two points. Simply type “LINE” into the command line and select the starting 
point. Then select the endpoint. You can also specify the length and angle of the line by typing in specific values. 
 
CIRCLE: It draws a circle or an arc. To use this command, type “CIRCLE” into the command line and specify the center point 
and radius. You can also create an arc by specifying the start and end angles. 
 
ARC: It draws an arc of a circle. To use this command, type “ARC” into the command line. Then specify the center point, radius, 
and start and end angles. 
 
OFFSET: This creates a parallel line or curve at a specific distance from an existing line or curve. To use this command, type 
“OFFSET” into the command line and select the object you want to offset. Lastly, specify the distance. 
 
TRIM: The TRIM command trims off parts of an object that extend beyond another object. To use this command, type “TRIM” 
into the command line and select the objects you want to trim. Then select the object that will be used as the cutting edge. 
 
EXTEND: The EXTEND command extends an object to meet another object. To use this command, type “EXTEND” into the 
command line and select the object you want to extend. Then select the object that will be used as the boundary edge. 
 
FILLET: The FILLET command rounds off the corners of two intersecting objects. To use this command, type “FILLET” into 
the command line, select the first object, and select the second object. Then specify the radius of the fillet. 
 
CHAMFER: It creates a beveled edge between two intersecting objects. To use this command, type “CHAMFER” into the 
command line, select the first object, and select the second object. Then specify the distance and angle of the chamfer. 
 
MIRROR: This command is used to create a mirror image of an object. To use this command, type “MIRROR” into the 
command line and select the object you want to mirror. Then select the mirror line. 
 
ARRAY: The ARRAY command creates a pattern of multiple objects. To use this command, type “ARRAY” into the command 
line, select the object you want to duplicate, and specify the number of rows and columns. Then specify the spacing between the 
objects. 
 
RECTANGLE: The RECTANGLE command draws rectangles. To use this command, type “RECTANGLE” in the command 
line. Specify the first corner point and then specify the opposite corner point. 
 
POLYLINE: The POLYLINE command draws a series of connected lines and arcs. To use this command, type “POLYLINE” in 
the command line and specify the first point. Then continue adding points. 
 
HATCH: The HATCH command fills an enclosed area with a pattern. To use this command, type “HATCH” in the command 
line and select the area to be hatched. Then specify the hatch pattern and scale. 
 
DIMENSION: The DIMENSION command adds dimensions to your drawing. To use this command, type “DIMENSION” in the 
command line and select the objects to be dimensioned. Then specify the location and type of dimension. 
 
MTEXT: The MTEXT command adds multiline text to your drawing. To use this command, type “MTEXT” in the command line 
and specify the insertion point. Then enter your text. 
 
MODIFY COMMANDS: 
 
ADCENTER/ADC: This command allows you to insert or manage content such as blocks, hatch patterns, and xrefs. You can 
access the content from a single dialog box, making it easier to find and use. 
 
ALIGN/AL: This command allows you to align objects with other objects in 2D and 3D. You can align objects based on different 
criteria such as endpoints, centers, and edges. 
  
8  
BASE: This command allows you to alter the base point of a drawing without changing its origin. You can move the base point to a 
different location. It can be useful when working with blocks or other objects. 
 
B PARAMETER/PARAM: This command allows you to add a parameter with grips to a dynamic block definition. You can use 
this command to make a block more flexible. 
 
BREAK: This command allows you to create a break (or gaps) in objects at one or two points. You can use this command to break 
up a line or object into smaller parts. 
 
BSAVE: This command allows you to save the current block definition. You can use this command to save a block you created or 
modified. 
 
BURST: This command allows you to explode a block but retain its attribute settings and layer definition. You can use this 
command to convert a block back into individual objects. 
 
CHA/CHAMFER: This command allows you to add slanted edges to sharp corners of objects. You can use this command to add 
a bevel or chamfer the corner of a shape. 
 
COPYBASE: This command allows you to copy an object according to a base point. You can use this command to make a copy of 
an object. 
 
DIVIDE: This command allows you to divide objects into multiple equal parts. You can use this command to create evenly-spaced 
points or lines. 
 
F/FILLET: This command allows you to add rounded corners to the sharp edges of objects. You can use this command to make 
the corners of a shape smoother. 
 
LA/LAYERS: This command allows you to open the Layer Properties Manager Palette. It allows you to tweak the settings for 
layers. You can use this command to manage the properties of different layers. 
 
MA/MATCHPROPERTIES: This command allows you to copy the properties of one object onto another. You can use this 
command to quickly apply the same properties to multiple objects. 
 
MOCORO: This command allows you to move, copy, rotate, and scale an object in one command. You can use this command to 
perform multiple modifications to an object at once. 
 
OVERKILL: This command allows you to remove overlapping or unnecessary objects from your work. You can use this command 
to clean up your drawing and improve its performance. 
 
PURGE: This command allows you to remove unused objects from a drawing. You can use this command to remove any objects 
that are no longer needed in your drawing. 
 
SC/SCALE: This command allows you to change the scale of an object. You can use this command to resize an object without 
changing its proportions. 
 
SCALETEXT: This command allows you to change the scale of the text. You can use it to resize text to fit a specific space. 
TEXTFIT: This command allows you to alter the size of a piece of text. You can use it to resize text to fit a specific area. 
TEXTTOFRONT: Brings annotations to the front. 
TORIENT: Changes the orientation of the text. 
 
TR/TRIM: Trims a shape or line. 
 
UNITS: Alters the unit settings of your drawing. 
 
X/EXPLODE: Breaks up an object into its individual components—i.e., a polyline into simple lines. 
 
XBIND/XB: Binds the definitions of named objects in an xref. 
 
 
DISPLAY COMMANDS: 
 
ZOOM: Increases or decreases the apparent size of objects in the current viewport. Choose, Click, Type – All, Extents, 
Previous, Window, Number, Number X, Center, Dynamic.  
9  
 
PAN: Shifts the location of a view. Choose, Click, Type. REDRAW AND REGEN: Redraw refreshes the current view 
BLIPMODE: Controls the display of marker blips. When Blip mode is ON, a temporary mark in the shape of a plus sign (+) 
appears where points are specified. BLIPMODE is OFF by default.
