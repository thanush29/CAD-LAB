Exp No: 8 KNUCKLE JOINT 3D DRAWING 
 
Aim: To develop the part drawing of Knuckle Joint from orthographic to isometric representation. 
 
 
PROCEDURE: 
 
1. Create the parts using Extrude and Revolve commands 
2. For constructing holes and cutout, use hole command and cutout commands 
3. After constructing each part save it as a separate part file with extension. par. 
4. Assembly the various parts using the various assembly constrains (planer, design, mate, axial 
align, connect etc). 
5. Save the assembly as a file with extension .asm. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Result: Thus the part drawing of the Knuckle Joint from Orthographic to Isometric representation is drawn 
successfully.
